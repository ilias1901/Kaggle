# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
In this project I've 
I've made an analytic reseach in Titanic's passengers dataset and prepared the prediction model for survivors.

## Task
We need to:
1) Analyze and clean the data;
2) Build a model that will be able predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

## Conclusion
The best result is shown by the **XGBClassifier**.

**Area Under the Curve score* = 0.88

`Pclass` and `Sex` are shown as the most important.

## Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, phik, sklearn, xgboost 

## Status of the project
Imroving
